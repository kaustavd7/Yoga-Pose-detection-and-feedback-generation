# Pose Detection And Feedback Generation For Different Yoga Asanas

## About the project

- We have created a comprehensive classification framework for yoga poses, with the goal of accurately identifying the specific posture being demonstrated by the participant in a given video recording.
- Develop a structured feedback mechanism for evaluating yoga pose videos, focusing on aligning them with the standards of an ideal yoga demonstration.

### Dataset and Feature Extraction

- Download yoga_data.zip file
- 

- Clone the git repository

Once the repository is cloned, open the Yoga_Classification folder

1. ** Yoga Classification
- Begin by executing the preproc-seq.ipynb script. This will generate six .npy files denoted as "trainX", "testX", "valX", "trainY", "testY", and "valY".
- Proceed with the CNN-LSTM-model.ipynb script. This step involves generating and evaluating the model weights using the test data.
- Lastly, execute the predict-continuous-FINAL.ipynb script. This enables the prediction of yoga asanas for any given video.
